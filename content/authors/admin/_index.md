David Bello Jiménez – As a biologist who has obtained a master's degree in Geomatics, Remote Sensing, and Spatial Models applied to Forest Management from the University of Cordoba, I have acquired a diverse range of skills and expertise. As a freelancer, I have utilized this knowledge to conduct comprehensive works in environmental GIS analyses, cartography, and topography.

Beyond my technical skills, I also possess a strong passion for environmental management and quality processes, with a genuine commitment to sustainable development, clean energy, and corporate social responsibility. My expertise in consulting and auditing has enabled me to assist organizations in achieving their environmental goals while adhering to the principles of a circular economy and reducing their carbon footprint.
